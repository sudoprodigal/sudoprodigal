  - python tools and libraries such as: numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, pytorch, keras etc.
  - LLMs: transformers and other DeepLearning techniques
  - Would like to explore diffusion methods for image generation (can run the tools but dont grok the math yet)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Open source projects contribution with a focus on macOS arm64, Linux (amd64/aarch64) compatibility/porting
